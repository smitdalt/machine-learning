### Machine Learning

This course provides an introduction to machine learning. Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions.

Topic categories include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Students will learn how to apply machine learning methods to solve problems in computer vision, natural language processing, classification, and prediction. Fundamental and current state-of-the-art methods including boosting and deep learning will be covered. Students will reinforce their learning of machine learning algorithms with hands-on tutorial oriented laboratory exercises using Jupyter Notebooks.

Prerequisites: MA-262 Probability and Statistics; programming maturity, and the ability to program in Python.  

Helpful: CS3851 Algorithms, MA-383 Linear Algebra, Data Science.  

ABET: Math/Science, Engineering Topics.

2-2-3 (class hours/week, laboratory hours/week, credits)

Lectures are augmented with hands-on tutorials using Jupyter Notebooks. Laboratory assignments will be completed using Python and related data science packages: NumPy, Pandas, ScipPy, StatsModels, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch.

Outcomes:   
- Understand the basic process of machine learning.    
- Understand the concepts of learning theory, i.e., what is learnable, bias, variance, overfitting.  
- Understand the concepts and application of supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning.  
- The ability to analyze a data set including the ability to understand which data attributes (dimensions) affect the outcome.  
- Understand the application of learned models to problems in classification, prediction, clustering, computer vision, and NLP.  
- Understand deep learning concepts and architectures including representation learning Multi-layer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Attention Mechanisms.
