    "*Advantages of decision trees are:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can fit complex non-linear decision spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalization, dummy variables need to be created, and blank values to be removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in a neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Note: some decision tree models require support for missing values.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*The disadvantages of decision trees include:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision-tree learners can create overly complex trees that do not generalize the data well. This is called **overfitting**. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported by scikit-learn), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node, or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble, i.e., combining multiple decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be *NP-complete* under several aspects of optimality. Even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as using a **greedy algorithm**, where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity, or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with a decision tree."

    "Decision Trees (DTs) are considered a *non-parametric supervised learning method* used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonparametric statistics are statistics *not* based on parameterized families of probability distributions such as assuming we have a gaussian distribution that can be *parameterized* by the mean and variance of the distribution. The non-parametric model does not have any parameters: parameters are determined by the training data, not the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the example below, decision trees learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the *fitter* the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, a Random Forest is used to create an ensemble model of multiple trees. The decision trees are used to fit a sine curve with the addition of a noisy observation. As a result, it learns local linear regressions approximating the sine curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that if the maximum depth of the tree (controlled by the max_depth parameter) is set too high, the decision trees learn too fine of details in the training data and learn from the noise, i.e. they overfit.\n"

    "\n",
    "Here are common options for the splitting criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **classification error rate:** fraction of training observations in a region that don't belong to the most common class\n",
    "- **Gini index:** measure of total variance across classes in a region\n",
    "- **cross-entropy:** numerically similar to Gini index, but uses logarithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Which to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When growing a tree, Gini index and cross-entropy are better measures of \"node purity\" than classification error rate. The Gini index is faster to compute than cross-entropy, so it is generally preferred (and is used by scikit-learn by default).\n",
    "- When pruning a tree, classification error rate is preferable in order to maximize predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do some splits result in leaves with the same predicted class?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The split was performed to increase node purity, even though it didn't reduce the classification error.\n",
    "- Node purity is important because we're interested in the class proportions among the observations in each region."

    "### Handling categorical predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "Some implementations of classification trees will allow you to handle categorical predictors **without creating dummy variables**. When splitting on a categorical predictor, they will try splitting on **every possible combination of categories** to find the best split. In the example above, \"ChestPain:bc\" means that the left-hand branch consists of observations with the second and third ChestPain categories, and the right-hand branch consists of remaining observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unfortunately, scikit-learn's classification tree implementation does not support this approach.** Instead, here's how you can handle categorical predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a predictor only has **two possible values**, code it as a single binary variable (0 or 1). Since it's treated as a number, splits will naturally occur at 0.5.\n",
    "- If a predictor has **three or more possible values that are ordered**, code it as a single variable (1, 2, 3, etc). Splits will naturally occur at 1.5, 2.5, etc.\n",
    "- If a predictor has **three or more possible values that are unordered**, create dummy variables and drop one level as usual. The decision tree won't know that the dummy variables are related to one another, but that shouldn't matter in terms of predictive accuracy.\n",
    "- If a predictor has **thousands of possible unordered values**, then it may be best to code it as a single variable (1, 2, 3, etc) instead of using dummy variables to minimize the size of the resulting model. ([reference](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18736132/1636598))\n",
