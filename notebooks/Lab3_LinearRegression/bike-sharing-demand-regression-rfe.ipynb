    "### Supervised Learning: Linear Regression - Feature and Model Selection\n",

    "We will be working with the`Bike Sharing Demand` dataset from a prior Kaggle competition:  \n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment objective:** perform: \n",
    "- data analysis and visualization      \n",
    "- preprocessing and feature engineering \n",
    "- fit a uni-variate linear regression model   \n",
    "- fit a mutli-variate linear regression model   \n",
    "- evauate the importances of each feature  \n",
    "- identify a subset of features to maximize model performance .  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Description:**\n",
    "Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kaggle Objective:** \n",
    "You are provided hourly rental data spanning two years. For this competition, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. You must predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Fields:**  \n",
    "**datetime** - hourly date + timestamp    \n",
    "**season** - 1: spring, 2: summer, 3: fall, 4: winter    \n",
    "**holiday** - whether the day is (1) or is not (0) considered a holiday   \n",
    "**workingday** - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday   \n",
    "**weather** -    \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy    \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist    \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds      \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog \n",
    "**temp** - temperature in Celsius   \n",
    "**atemp** - \"feels like\" temperature in Celsius   \n",
    "**humidity** - relative humidity   \n",
    "**windspeed** - wind speed   \n",
    "**casual** - number of non-registered user rentals initiated   \n",
    "**registered** - number of registered user rentals initiated   \n",
    "**count** - number of total rentals  (casual + registered) .  \n",
